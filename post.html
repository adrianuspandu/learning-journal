        <h1 class="article-title">My journey as a bootcamp student</h1>
        <p class="article-desc">
          After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
          Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code
          reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

        <h2 class="article-heading">How I stay committed to learning</h2>
        <p class="article-text">
          I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple
          projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing
          projects. While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share
          what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
        </p>
        <h2 class="article-heading">
          How I got started I started simple and gradually grew my learning
          journal site.
        </h2>
        <p class="article-text">
          I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning
          session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but
          also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words. That
          helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my
          learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
